At this time exercise and focusing on our health has never been so important. As we stay home to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe from the virus. We can become more inactive neglecting our physical health and in turn our mental health suffers. 

That is why during this time of the pandemic I am offering 20% off my prices until 30th June. 
Launching today I am also offering personal online sessions to help you keep motivated from home. Whether you have equipement or not we can develop home workouts that would match the intensity of the gym. 
During this time you can also support me by buying a voucher for a in person 1-2-1 session. Vouchers will be valid for 12 months from the day the UK goverment declare lockdown is lifted in some form that can allow small groups to meet.

Although there is alot of unknowns right now about when things will open. I understand peoples anxiety about going back into the gym in the near future.
I want my clients to feel as comfortable and supported as possible. This means I am considering workouts outside in local public parks or private open spaces once measures are lifted to do so.

For more infomation on Online 1-2-1 training or booking Vouchers please contact me via email or social media"
