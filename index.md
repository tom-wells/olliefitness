It's time for a fresh start. If you are looking to improve your physical, mental and social health now is no better time.

To help you begin I am offering an introductory discount on all my new services for new and existing clients.

Whether you want guidance working out from home or a 1-2-1 session in person. We can develop workouts that would match the intensity of the gym and help you reach your goals.

Currently all in-person training is to be taken at outdoor locations in the Maidstone area. Group sessions of up to 5 people will be available from 1st of June.

For more information on services or bookings, please contact me via phone, email or social media.
